# PythC
Online Compiler, Plus Dynamic Lesson platform, PythC is an on-line compiler/interpreter. Now people can code online with the full power of python at their fingertips! Also, people can learn and teach python and CS fundamentals, through my dynamic lesson platform! This allows users to take built in lessons, as well as create lessons for other users to take and take lessons created from other users.  With the sign in user system users can have an organized view as to what they have completed. I also implemented a gamification system for the app to give users more initiative to learn.<br/>
